# Optimizing-a-Healthcare-Network-for-Improved-Service-Delivery

# Introduction
The Washington State Health Ministry would like to optimally upgrade staff or resources in existing facilities across Washington so that they can allocate resources to where they are most needed, based on demand for services in different geographic regions/areas. The document proposes the following solutions to address this problem 

•	Optimizing the resource allocation process by increasing the resources capacity in some facilities and decreasing capacity in others to allocate resources where they are most needed, hence making services more accessible to patients.

•	Calculating the travel time from one area facility to another, and visualizing the distance on map so that people only travel to their nearby facility, therefore minimizing the time and distance cost.
